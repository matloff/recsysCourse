\chapter{Statistical Models}  
\label{chap:mixed} 

Let $Y_{ij}$ denote the rating user $i$ gives item $j$.   As before,
most of these values are unknown, and thus we wish to predict them.
That latter point suggests regression modeling, which we will do in this
chapter.  We'll use both the classical linear and logistic models, as
well as machine learning methods.
